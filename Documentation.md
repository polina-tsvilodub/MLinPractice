## Evaluation Schema

## Baseline
We decided to use a stratified (a.k.a. label frequency based) baseline classifier to account for the embalance of the labels.
A stratified dummy classifier should be more robust in regard to this and therefore is a more challenging baseline to surpass.
Using this dummy classifier we also want to test whether "fancy" features are necessary or not for the classification.

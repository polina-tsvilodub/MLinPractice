## Evaluation Schema
This project uses 5-fold cross validation to train and evaluate the classifiers.
Specifically, we use stratified cross validation to make sure that each fold is a good representative of the whole data.
Additinally, by using cross validation we use our whole data set to train and test our classifier.

## Baseline
We decided to use a stratified (a.k.a. label frequency based) baseline classifier to account for the embalance of the labels.
A stratified dummy classifier should be more robust in regard to this and therefore is a more challenging baseline to surpass.
Using this dummy classifier we also want to test whether "fancy" features are necessary or not for the classification.
